## Automatic Fish Feeder


The goal of this project was to make improvements to an existing market product and make it more marketable. </br>
This was an *individual project* carried out for the *Semester 4 Module EN2160 - Electronic Design Realization.*


The product that was implemented was an automatic fish feeder. </br>
The **improvements** and **extra features** that were incorporated to set it apart from existing products are as follows,
- ***Simple User Interface and Controls*** – Upon market research it was apparent that most of the existing products had heavily cluttered interfaces and control panels. Simplification of the user interface and hence improving the user experience was the biggest focus of this product.
- ***Mountable on both sides*** – This was designed to be mounted on either sides of a fish tank by incorporating replicated indicators and controls on 2 sides.
- ***Level Detection*** – Capable of indicating to the user when the fish food in the storage compartment has gone below a certain level. Indications were done redundantly using both sound and light indications for better notifying the user.
- ***Touch Sensor*** – Instead of using push buttons like existing market products, touch sensors were utilized.

The project involved designing the circuit from scratch according to the set requirements, fabrication of a printed circuit board, hand soldering components, circuit testing and design of a 3D printed enclosure to encase everything in a suitable form factor.

Software tools including *VSCode*, *Arduino IDE*, *Proteus Design Suite*, *Altium Designer* and *SolidWorks* were utilized.
